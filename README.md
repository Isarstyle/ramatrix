<h3>Dependencies</h3>
You will need to have Node (6), Gulp, webpack, and webpack-dev-server installed on your system globally. After installing node, run
the following:

```
npm install -g gulp webpack webpack-dev-server
```

<h3>Compiling for development</h3>

Simply run `npm install` and `gulp build-dev` from the root of the project.  This will load webpack-dev-server on port 8080.
